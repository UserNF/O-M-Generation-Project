Create Trello board with TODO list items:
xhow to read word documents (or pdfs) for info
xcreate word document (preferably pdfs) with text read from the original pdf
xRestructure the test pdf to match what a typical technical literature looks like
xSearch for specific titles in the pdf
xget the product codes and corresponding literature by checking a few parameters (Order Code)
	If the order code is found, then
xStore documents in folder
https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/api.html#camelot.read_pdf
xStore the order codes and corresponding document names in a dictionary for later use in a technical literature index
How to search for missing product documents from the folder? (test each method and derive pros and cons for each(
	Manual setup?	
		Store all necessary pdfs in a pre-existing dictionary and access them through a code number
	Automated Setup?
		simply drag and drop documents in a folder to Run a full search for each document, if nothing shows up, run a partial search through each document
			It should catch 

xManual Set Up
	+Guaranteed Accuracy 
	-Limited
	-Harder to use

UI SEtup
	Make UI based on CTK radio group pane and place buttons inside
Create a button that gets the directory of the technical literature index
	directory issue

make a prompt that gets the user to enter the project name and number for the o&m index

*Check to see if all titles of each code exist within the merged documents


Generate an O&M index page that holds all product data in the correct order
genereate an O&M manual that  prints only the relevant documents

edge cases
Create a basic ui where the user can find the document to read
ask others to desing the ui based on a couple rules
Select which pdfs to read via a gui
highlighting things



contain all this within custom tkinter (adhere to the template project for this)

if there's time:
(for later) Automatic
	+Easier to use
	+unlimited
	-potentially less accurate


create a merged file that merges only the existing documents from 
	Get the order code and find the documentws
